# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization

 The aim of this project is to develop a solution that extracts, transforms, and visualizes data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The process involves:

# 1. Data Extraction:
Scripting to clone the repository and collect data.

# 2. Data Transformation:
Using Python and Pandas to clean and structure the data.

# 3. Database Insertion:
Storing transformed data in a MYSQL database.

# 4. Dashboard Creation:
Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard.

# 5. Data Retrieval:
Fetching data from the database to dynamically update the dashboard.
